Behold, the world's worst chatbot. 

Reads any existing tasks from `data/tom.txt` and saves new tasks (and updates to them) to the same text file. 
Directory and text file will be created if they don't already exist.
Tasks are saved in format
```
[PRIORITY] TASK_TYPE | MARKED | DESCRIPTION | [DATES]
```
where `PRIORITY` is either empty (low priority) or an asterisk (high priority), `TASK_TYPE` is the first 
letter of the respective task names, and `MARKED` is either 1 (marked) or 0 (unmarked). `DATES` are the
deadline, start date/time and end date/time when applicable.
